# Daniel Fu, PhD
ML Research

# Intro 👋

* I did my PhD at Duke University in Computer Science with [John Reif](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~reif/), working on architectures for molecular-scale computing, digital twins of biological self-assembly, and software-automated design methodologies for complex DNA nanostructures.
* I'm currently a Postdoc at Emory University with [Yonggang Ke](https://kelaboratory.wixsite.com/ke-lab), working on experimental-to-ML pipelines for protein dynamics and ML models for small-variation sequence-resolved molecular behavior prediction in large DNA computing systems.

I am currently on the job market.
